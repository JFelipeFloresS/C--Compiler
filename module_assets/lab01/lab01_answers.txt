Answer the following Questions

First, analyze the source code of the mini-compiler. Then, try to answer the following questions to
check that you fully understand the language implementation (this is the main purpose of this first
lab). Self-evaluation is provided with a document containing the answers, uploaded to Canvas (you
do not need to send or upload your answers).

1. Identify the Java packages that implement the different phases of the compiler (lexical, syntax and semantic analysis, and code generation).
Lexical: /src/parser
Syntax: /src/parser
Semantic analysis: /src/semantic
Code generation: /src/codegeneration

2. Which file describes the lexical specification of the language?
/src/parser/Cmm.g4

3. Which file describes the syntax specification of the language?
/src/parser/Cmm.g4

4. In which package(s) is (are) the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) implemented?
/src/ast and /src/ast/types

5. What is the type (i.e., class or interface) that generalizes any node of the AST?
/src/ast/ASTNode.java

6. What is the concrete (non-abstract) AST node that represents the whole source program?
/src/ast/Program.java

7. Do you recognize the design pattern used to model ASTs?
Composite Design Pattern

8. How many passes (AST traversals) are performed in the semantic-analysis phase?
2: IdentificationVisitor and TypeCheckingVisitor

9 .What general type models/represents any AST traversal? Do you know the design pattern used?
/src/visitor/Visitor.java
Visitor Design Pattern

10. Enumerate the different traversals defined in this particular implementation?
1. IdentificationVisitor
2. TypeCheckingVisitor
3. OffsetVisitor - not in answer sheet?
4. ExecuteCGVisitor
    4.1. ValueCGVisitor
    4.2. AddressCGVisitor

11. Which is the pass (traversal) that checks that variables must be defined before their use? Which phase does that traversal belong to?
IdentificationVisitor during semantic analysis

12. Where is the main responsibility to infer the type of an addition expression placed? (i.e., what method should be modified if we want to change the current behavior)
/src/ast/types/Type.java
Change method arithmetic

13. Where is the responsibility of computing the MAPL size in bytes for each type in the source language placed?
/src/ast/types/Type.java
Method numberOfBytes

14. In code generation, why are there two different classes for pushing values and addresses of expressions?
because the behaviour is different between left and right sides of the AST nodes

15. Which traversal directs the code generation process of the whole program (using other traversals)?
ExecuteCGVisitor
